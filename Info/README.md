# Map Upgrade

Have you ever thought that it is just a little too nice of the taxman to have handed you such a powerful and convenient map right from the get-go? Well, fear no more! This mod disables the map by default (configurable), requiring a new upgrade to unlock it. Subsequent upgrades even significantly increase map range!

Also adds the ability to zoom the minimap via the scroll wheel for extra QOL.

Highly configurable, so that you can enjoy the game with less frustration.

Note that this mod requires all players to have it installed.
